=head1 all_entities_Media

Return all instances of the Media entity.

A media describes the chemical content of the solution in which cells
are grown in an experiment or for the purposes of a model. The key is the
common media name. The nature of the media is described by its relationship
to its constituent compounds.

Example:

    all_entities_Media -a 

would retrieve all entities of type Media and include all fields
in the entities in the output.

=head2 Related entities

The Media entity has the following relationship links:

=over 4

=head2 Command-Line Options

=over 4

=item -a

Return all fields.

=item -h

Display a list of the fields available for use.

=item -fields field-list

Choose a set of fields to return. Field-list is a comma-separated list of 
strings. The following fields are available:

=over 4

=item mod_date

=item name

=item is_minimal

=item source_id

=item type

=head2 Output Format

The standard output is a tab-delimited file. It consists of the input
file with an extra column added for each requested field.  Input lines that cannot
be extended are written to stderr.
